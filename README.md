# DrData: Software to Objectively Quantify Pruritus in PBC Patients

**DrData** is an AI-powered platform designed to improve the monitoring and management of patient health, with a special focus on those suffering from **Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)** and chronic pruritus (itching). It supports both medical professionals and patients, offering tools for efficient communication, objective symptom tracking, and data-driven clinical decisions.

## Project Objective

The aim is to develop an **objective method to quantify pruritus** in PBC patients, addressing the current lack of validated approaches that make diagnosis and treatment challenging. By combining wearable technology, AI analysis, and robust data models, DrData seeks to generate actionable insights that enhance clinical outcomes and support ongoing research.

## Key Features

* **Symptom Tracking:** Patients can answer daily questionnaires about their symptoms, such as itching, and visualize their collected data through mobile devices like smart bands or rings.

* **Objective Pruritus Quantification:** The platform uses an AI-driven clustering model, aligned with recommendations from medical organizations such as the **NIH** and **AMIA**, to provide reliable and objective measures of itch severity.

* **Medical History:** Doctors can view each patient’s medical history and monitor their condition over time.

* **Appointments and Communication:** Patients can request appointments and communicate directly with their doctors through an integrated chat.

* **Multi-Platform Compatibility:** DrData is compatible with various medical devices and accessible from multiple platforms, offering intuitive interfaces for both healthcare providers and patients.

## Technology

The platform is built using **React** and developed with the support of **Lovable**. Its AI model has been trained on more than 9,000 tests and employs advanced clustering techniques to analyze and classify patient data, ensuring accurate and medically validated recommendations.

## Stakeholders

* **Primary:** Doctors, researchers, and patients.
* **Secondary:** Hospitals, labs, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory bodies.
* **Tertiary:** Insurers, medical device manufacturers, and patients with related conditions.

## Current Status

**The project is in active development.** We are refining data collection methods, testing our AI models, and collaborating with medical professionals to validate and improve the system. This projects is just a prototype.

## How to Run the Project Locally

To run DrData on your local machine, make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. Then, in the project’s root directory, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and allow you to access the platform through your browser.
