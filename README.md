# Objective Quantification of Pruritus in PBC (Ongoing Research)

## Project Overview

This research seeks to develop an objective method to quantify pruritus (itching) in **Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)**, addressing the lack of validated approaches that complicate diagnosis and treatment. Our goal is to provide **data-driven insights** for better clinical decisions and research support.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary:** Medical professionals, researchers, and patients.
- **Secondary:** Hospitals, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators.
- **Tertiary:** Insurers, medical device manufacturers, and patients with related conditions.

## Approach

We are developing a system integrating:

- **Wearable sensors** for scratch detection.
- **AI-driven analysis** of movement patterns.
- **Machine learning models** for pruritus quantification.
- **Data dashboards** for clinical insights.

## Current Status

**This project is still in development.** We are refining data collection methods, testing initial models, and collaborating with medical professionals.

## Next Steps

- **Prototype development & pilot testing.**
- **Clinical validation & regulatory assessment.**
- **Scaling for broader adoption.**



**Disclaimer**: This research is ongoing, and methodologies may evolve based on further testing and validation.
